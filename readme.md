## Answer 
1. getElementById -is select a single element by id. getElementsByClassName - it brings all the classes with the same name. querySelector - When used, it gives the first matching element. It works directly like a CSS class or id. 
querySelectorAll - This will apply to all elements with the same name. It can also be written like CSS class and id.
