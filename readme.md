## Answer 
1. getElementById -is select a single element by id. getElementsByClassName - it brings all the classes with the same name. querySelector - When used, it gives the first matching element. It works directly like a CSS class or id. querySelectorAll - This will apply to all elements with the same name. It can also be written like CSS class and id.
2.Create a new element by typing document.createElement.Then give .innerText to write something and .innerhtml to add HTML file Find the parent element where I want to place it. Then insert that text or html into that parent with .appendChild().
